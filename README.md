AI-Powered Weather & Productivity Tracker:

Project Description
A smart dashboard that correlates weather conditions with user productivity patterns, offering data-driven insights to optimize work/study efficiency. By analyzing environmental factors and activity data, it provides personalized recommendations to enhance focus and time management.

Key Features
1. Core Features
a. Weather-Productivity Correlation: Identifies how temperature, humidity, and weather conditions affect focus levels.

b. AI-Powered Insights: Generates personalized suggestions using heuristic analysis and optional AI APIs (Cohere/Hugging Face).

c. Pomodoro Timer: Integrated focus timer with smart break recommendations based on current conditions.

d. Activity Tracking: Logs app/website usage and idle time via ActivityWatch integration.

2. Dashboard Views
Real-Time Snapshot: Current weather + productivity metrics.

Historical Trends: Charts comparing performance across different weather conditions.

Insight Feed: Actionable recommendations (e.g., "You focus best on cloudy mornings").

3. Privacy-Focused
All data processed locally (optional cloud API for advanced AI).

No user data stored externally.

Technology Framework
Frontend
Framework: Vite + Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules)

UI: CSS Grid/Flexbox, responsive design (mobile-first)

Visualization: Chart.js or D3.js for data charts

Styling: CSS variables for light/dark theme toggling

Backend & APIs
Weather Data: OpenWeather API (free tier)

Productivity Tracking: ActivityWatch (local self-hosted API)

AI Suggestions:

Primary: Rule-based heuristics (local analysis)

Optional: Cohere AI or Hugging Face (free-tier APIs)

Data Handling
Storage: localStorage for user preferences + session data

Analysis: JavaScript modules for correlation logic

Deployment
Hosting: Netlify (frontend), Render (backend if expanded)

Build Tool: Vite (fast development bundler)
